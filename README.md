A Bot more useless than me, more unefficent than me learning and way cooler than me  
it is a small Project I did in 2021 to learn Python and the Discord API, it is very poorly coded, even worse documented and a horrificly structured.  
In the time since this project, I have landed 1 Internship, 2 Jobs, got into a "gifted" Programm at the Technical University of Munich and competed in countless competitions.  
My Code has become incredibly better und my Style and Approach have grown significantly from this Project, it still however was one of my largest (not NDA) Project and the thing that started it all.  
I might revisit this Project since its completely deprecated.
